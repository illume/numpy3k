Abstract
========

This PEP proposes re-designing the buffer interface (PyBufferProcs
function pointers) to improve the way Python allows memory sharing
in Python 3.0

In particular, it is proposed that the character buffer portion 
of the API be elminated and the multiple-segment portion be 
re-designed in conjunction with allowing for strided memory
to be shared.   In addition, the new buffer interface will 
allow the sharing of any multi-dimensional nature of the
memory and what data-format the memory contains. 

This interface will allow any extension module to either 
create objects that share memory or create algorithms that
use and manipulate raw memory from arbitrary objects that 
export the interface. 


Rationale
=========

The Python 2.X buffer protocol allows different Python types to
exchange a pointer to a sequence of internal buffers.  This
functionality is *extremely* useful for sharing large segments of
memory between different high-level objects, but it is too limited and
has issues:

1. There is the little used "sequence-of-segments" option
   (bf_getsegcount) that is not well motivated. 

2. There is the apparently redundant character-buffer option
   (bf_getcharbuffer)

3. There is no way for a consumer to tell the buffer-API-exporting
   object it is "finished" with its view of the memory and
   therefore no way for the exporting object to be sure that it is
   safe to reallocate the pointer to the memory that it owns (for
   example, the array object reallocating its memory after sharing
   it with the buffer object which held the original pointer led
   to the infamous buffer-object problem).

4. Memory is just a pointer with a length. There is no way to
   describe what is "in" the memory (float, int, C-structure, etc.)

5. There is no shape information provided for the memory.  But,
   several array-like Python types could make use of a standard
   way to describe the shape-interpretation of the memory
   (wxPython, GTK, pyQT, CVXOPT, PyVox, Audio and Video
   Libraries, ctypes, NumPy, data-base interfaces, etc.)

6. There is no way to share discontiguous memory (except through
   the sequence of segments notion).  

   There are two widely used libraries that use the concept of
   discontiguous memory: PIL and NumPy.  Their view of discontiguous
   arrays is different, though.  The proposed buffer interface allows
   sharing of either memory model.  Exporters will use only one        
   approach and consumers may choose to support discontiguous 
   arrays of each type however they choose. 

   NumPy uses the notion of constant striding in each dimension as its
   basic concept of an array. With this concept, a simple sub-region
   of a larger array can be described without copying the data.   T
   Thus, stride information is the additional information that must be
   shared. 

   The PIL uses a more opaque memory representation. Sometimes an
   image is contained in a contiguous segment of memory, but sometimes
   it is contained in an array of pointers to the contiguous segments
   (usually lines) of the image.  The PIL is where the idea of multiple
   buffer segments in the original buffer interface came from.   

   NumPy's strided memory model is used more often in computational
   libraries and because it is so simple it makes sense to support
   memory sharing using this model.  The PIL memory model is sometimes 
   used in C-code where a 2-d array can be then accessed using double
   pointer indirection:  e.g. image[i][j].  

   The buffer interface should allow the object to export either of these
   memory models.  Consumers are free to either require contiguous memory
   or write code to handle one or both of these memory models. 

Proposal Overview
=================

* Eliminate the char-buffer and multiple-segment sections of the
  buffer-protocol.

* Unify the read/write versions of getting the buffer.

* Add a new function to the interface that should be called when
  the consumer object is "done" with the memory area.  

* Add a new variable to allow the interface to describe what is in
  memory (unifying what is currently done now in struct and
  array)

* Add a new variable to allow the protocol to share shape information

* Add a new variable for sharing stride information

* Add a new mechanism for sharing arrays that must 
  be accessed using pointer indirection. 

* Fix all objects in the core and the standard library to conform
  to the new interface

* Extend the struct module to handle more format specifiers

* Extend the buffer object into a new memory object which places
  a Python veneer around the buffer interface. 

* Add a few functions to make it easy to copy contiguous data
  in and out of object supporting the buffer interface. 

Specification
=============

While the new specification allows for complicated memory sharing.
Simple contiguous buffers of bytes can still be obtained from an
object.  In fact, the new protocol allows a standard mechanism for
doing this even if the original object is not represented as a
contiguous chunk of memory.

The easiest way is to use the provided C-API to obtain a contiguous
chunk of memory like the old buffer protocol allowed.


Change the PyBufferProcs structure to

::

    typedef struct {
         getbufferproc bf_getbuffer;
         releasebufferproc bf_releasebuffer;
    }


::

    typedef int (*getbufferproc)(PyObject *obj, struct bufferinfo *view) 

This function returns 0 on success and -1 on failure (and raises an
error). The first variable is the "exporting" object.  The second
argument is the address to a bufferinfo structure.  If view is NULL,
then no information is returned but a lock on the memory is still
obtained.  In this case, releasebuffer should also be called with NULL.

The bufferinfo structure is:

struct bufferinfo {
       void *buf;
       Py_ssize_t len;
       int readonly;
       char *format;
       int ndims;
       Py_ssize_t *shape;
       Py_ssize_t *strides;
       Py_ssize_t *suboffsets;
};

Upon return from getbufferproc, the bufferinfo structure is filled in
with relevant information about the buffer.  This same bufferinfo
structure must be passed to bf_releasebuffer (if available) when the
consumer is done with the memory. The caller is responsible for
keeping a reference to obj until releasebuffer is called.


The members of the bufferinfo structure are:

   
buf
    a pointer to the start of the memory for the object

len 
    the total bytes of memory the object uses.  This should be the
    same as the product of the shape array multiplied by the number of
    bytes per item of memory.

readonly
    an integer variable to hold whether or not the memory is
    readonly.  1 means the memory is readonly, zero means the
    memory is writeable.


format
    a format-string (following extended struct syntax) indicating what
    is in each element of of memory.  The number of elements is len /
    itemsize, where itemsize is the number of bytes implied by the
    format.  For standard unsigned bytes use a format string of "B".

ndims
    a variable storing the number of dimensions the memory represents.
    Should be >=0. 

shape
    an array of ``Py_ssize_t`` of length ``ndims`` indicating the
    shape of the memory as an N-D array.  Note that ``((*shape)[0] *
    ... * (*shape)[ndims-1])*itemsize = len``.  This can be NULL
    to indicate 1-d arrays. 

strides 
    address of a ``Py_ssize_t*`` variable that will be filled with a
    pointer to an array of ``Py_ssize_t`` of length ``*ndims``
    indicating the number of bytes to skip to get to the next element
    in each dimension.  If this is NULL, then the memory is assumed to
    be C-style contigous with the last dimension varying the fastest.

suboffsets
    address of a ``Py_ssize_t *`` variable that will be filled with a
    pointer to an array of ``Py_ssize_t`` of length ``*ndims``.  If
    these suboffset numbers are >=0, then the value stored along the
    indicated dimension is a pointer and the suboffset value dictates
    how many bytes to add to the pointer after de-referencing.  A
    suboffset value that it negative indicates that no de-referencing
    should occur (striding in a contiguous memory block).  If all 
    suboffsets are negative (i.e. no de-referencing is needed, then
    this must be NULL.

    For clarity, here is a function that returns a pointer to the
    element in an N-D array pointed to by an N-dimesional index when
    there are both strides and suboffsets.  

    void* get_item_pointer(int ndim, void* buf, Py_ssize_t* strides,
                           Py_ssize_t* suboffsets, Py_ssize_t *indices) {
        char* pointer = (char*)buf;
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i < ndim; i++) {
            pointer += strides[i]*indices[i];
            if (suboffsets[i] >=0 ) {
                pointer = *((char**)pointer) + suboffsets[i];
            }
        }
        return (void*)pointer;
    } 

    Notice the suboffset is added "after" the dereferencing occurs.
    Thus slicing in the ith dimension would add to the suboffsets in
    the i-1st dimension.  Slicing in the first dimension would change
    the location of the starting pointer directly (i.e. buf would
    be modified).  
    

The exporter is responsible for making sure the memory pointed to by
buf, format, shape, strides, and suboffsets is valid until
releasebuffer is called.  If the exporter wants to be able to change
shape, strides, and/or suboffsets before releasebuffer is called then
it should allocate those arrays when getbuffer is called and free them
when releasebuffer is called.


The same bufferinfo struct should be used in the other buffer
interface call. The caller is responsible for the memory of the
bufferinfo object itself.

``typedef int (*releasebufferproc)(PyObject *obj, struct bufferinfo *view)``
    Callers of getbufferproc must make sure that this function is
    called when memory previously acquired from the object is no
    longer needed.  The exporter of the interface must make sure that
    any memory pointed to in the bufferinfo structure remains valid
    until releasebuffer is called.

    Both of these routines are optional for a type object

    If the releasebuffer function is not provided then it does not ever
    need to be called. 
    
Exporters will need to define a releasebuffer function if they can
re-allocate their memory, strides, shape, suboffsets, or format
variables which they might share through the struct bufferinfo.
Several mechanisms could be used to keep track of how many getbuffer
calls have been made and shared.  Either a single variable could be
used to keep track of how many "views" have been exported, or a
linked-list of bufferinfo structures filled in could be maintained in
each objet.  All that is needed is to ensure that any memory shared
through the bufferinfo structure remains valid until releasebuffer is
called on that memory.


New C-API calls are proposed
============================

::

    int PyObject_CheckBuffer(PyObject *obj)

Return 1 if the getbuffer function is available otherwise 0.

::

    PyObject *PyObject_GetBuffer(PyObject *obj)

Return a memory-view object from an object that defines the buffer interface. 
If make_ro is non-zero then request that the memory is made read-only until 
release buffer is called. 

A memory-view object is an extended buffer object that should replace
the buffer object in Python 3K.  It's C-structure is

typedef struct {
    PyObject_HEAD
    PyObject *base;
    struct bufferinfo view;
    int itemsize;
    int flags;
} PyMemoryViewObject;

This is very similar to the current buffer object except offset has
been removed because ptr can just be modified by offset and a single
offset is not sufficient.  Also the hash has been removed because
using the buffer object as a hash even if it is read-only is rarely
useful.  

Also, the format, ndims, shape, strides, and suboffsets have been
added. These additions will allow multi-dimensional slicing of the
memory-view object which can be added at some point.  This object
always owns it's own shape, strides, and suboffsets arrays and it's
own format string, but always borrows the memory from the object
pointed to by base.

The itemsize is a convenience and specifies the number of bytes
indicated by the format string if positive.  

This object never reallocates ptr, shape, strides, subboffsets or
format and therefore does not need to keep track of how many views it
has exported.

It exports a view using the base object.  It releases a view by releasing
the view on the base object.  Because, it will never re-allocate memory, 
it does not need to keep track of how many it has exported but simple 
reference counting will suffice. 

::

    int PyObject_SizeFromFormat(char *)

Return the implied itemsize of the data-format area from a struct-style
description.

::

    int PyObject_GetContiguous(PyObject *obj, void **buf, Py_ssize_t *len,
                               int fortran)

Return a contiguous chunk of memory representing the buffer.  If a
copy is made then return 1.  If no copy was needed return 0.  If an
error occurred in probing the buffer interface, then return -1.  The
contiguous chunk of memory is pointed to by ``*buf`` and the length of
that memory is ``*len``.  If the object is multi-dimensional, then if
fortran is 1, the first dimension of the underlying array will vary
the fastest in the buffer.  If fortran is 0, then the last dimension
will vary the fastest (C-style contiguous). If fortran is -1, then it
does not matter and you will get whatever the object decides is easiest.

:: 

    int PyObject_CopyToObject(PyObject *obj, void *buf, Py_ssize_t len,
                              int fortran)

Copy ``len`` bytes of data pointed to by the contiguous chunk of
memory pointed to by ``buf`` into the buffer exported by obj.  Return
0 on success and return -1 and raise an error on failure.  If the
object does not have a writeable buffer, then an error is raised.  If
fortran is 1, then if the object is multi-dimensional, then the data
will be copied into the array in Fortran-style (first dimension varies
the fastest).  If fortran is 0, then the data will be copied into the
array in C-style (last dimension varies the fastest).  If fortran is -1, then
it does not matter and the copy will be made in whatever way is
easiest. 

The last two C-API calls allow a standard way of getting data in and
out of Python objects into contiguous memory areas no matter how it is
actually stored.  These calls use the extended buffer interface to perform
their work. 

::
    int PyObject_IsContiguous(struct bufferinfo *view);

Return 1 if the memory defined by the view object is C-style
contiguous.  Return 0 otherwise.

::
    void PyObject_FillContiguousStrides(int *ndims, Py_ssize_t *shape,
                                        int itemsize, 
                                        Py_ssize_t *strides)

Fill the strides array with byte-strides of a contiguous array of the
given shape with the given number of bytes per element. 



Additions to the struct string-syntax
=====================================

The struct string-syntax is missing some characters to fully
implement data-format descriptions already available elsewhere (in
ctypes and NumPy for example).  The Python 2.5 specification is 
at http://docs.python.org/lib/module-struct.html

Here are the proposed additions:


================  ===========
Character         Description
================  ===========
't'               bit (number before states how many bits)
'?'               platform _Bool type
'g'               long double  
'Z'               complex (whatever the next specifier is)
'c'               ucs-1 (latin-1) encoding 
'u'               ucs-2 
'w'               ucs-4 
'O'               pointer to Python Object 
'T{}'             structure (detailed layout inside {}) 
'(k1,k2,...,kn)'  multi-dimensional array of whatever follows 
':name:'          optional name of the preceeding element 
'&'               specific pointer (prefix before another charater) 
'X{}'             pointer to a function (optional function 
                                         signature inside {})
' '               ignored (allow better readability)
================  ===========

The struct module will be changed to understand these as well and
return appropriate Python objects on unpacking.  Un-packing a
long-double will return a decimal object.  Unpacking 'u' or
'w' will return Python unicode.  Unpacking a multi-dimensional
array will return a list of lists.  Un-packing a pointer will
return a ctypes pointer object.  Un-packing a bit will return a
Python Bool.  Spaces in the struct-string syntax will be ignored.
Unpacking a named-object will return a Python class with attributes 
having those names. 

Endian-specification ('=','>','<') is also allowed inside the
string so that it can change if needed.  The previously-specified
endian string is in force until changed.  The default endian is '='.

According to the struct-module, a number can preceed a character
code to specify how many of that type there are.  The
(k1,k2,...,kn) extension also allows specifying if the data is
supposed to be viewed as a (C-style contiguous, last-dimension
varies the fastest) multi-dimensional array of a particular format.

Functions should be added to ctypes to create a ctypes object from
a struct description, and add long-double, and ucs-2 to ctypes.

Examples of Data-Format Descriptions
====================================

Here are some examples of C-structures and how they would be
represented using the struct-style syntax:

float
    'f'
complex double
    'Zd'
RGB Pixel data
    'BBB' or 'B:r: B:g: B:b:'
Mixed endian (weird but possible)
    '>i:big: <i:little:'
Nested structure
    ::

        struct {
             int ival;
             struct {
                 unsigned short sval;
                 unsigned char bval;
                 unsigned char cval;
             } sub;
        }
        'i:ival: T{H:sval: B:bval: B:cval:}:sub:'
Nested array
    ::

        struct {
             int ival;
             double data[16*4];
        }
        'i:ival: (16,4)d:data:'

Code to be affected
===================

All objects and modules in Python that export or consume the old
buffer interface will be modified.  Here is a partial list.

* buffer object
* bytes object
* string object
* array module
* struct module
* mmap module
* ctypes module

Anything else using the buffer API.  


Issues and Details
==================

The proposed locking mechanism relies entirely on the exporter object
to not invalidate any of the memory pointed to by the buffer structure
until a corresponding releasebuffer is called.  If it wants to be able
to change its own shape and/or strides arrays, then it needs to create
memory for these in the bufferinfo structure and copy information
over.

The sharing of strided memory and suboffsets is new and can be seen as
a modification of the multiple-segment interface.  It is motivated by
NumPy and the PIL.  NumPy objects should be able to share their
strided memory with code that understands how to manage strided memory
because strided memory is very common when interfacing with compute
libraries.

Also with this approach it should be possible to write generic code
that works with both kinds of memory.

Memory management of the format string, the shape array, the strides
array, and the suboffsets array in the bufferinfo structure is always
the responsibility of the exporting object.  The consumer should not
set these pointers to any other memory or try to free them. 

Code
========

The authors of the PEP promise to contribute and maintain the code for
this proposal but will welcome any help.


Examples
=========

Ex. 1
----------

This example shows how an image object that uses contiguous lines might expose its buffer. 

struct rgba {
    unsigned char r, g, b, a;
};

struct ImageObject {
    PyObject_HEAD;
    ...
    struct rgba** lines;
    Py_ssize_t height;
    Py_ssize_t width;
    Py_ssize_t shape_array[2];
    Py_ssize_t stride_array[2];
    Py_ssize_t view_count;
};

"lines" points to malloced 1-D array of (struct rgba*).  Each pointer
in THAT block points to a seperately malloced array of (struct rgba).

In order to access, say, the red value of the pixel at x=30, y=50, you'd use "lines[50][30].r".

So what does ImageObject's getbuffer do?  Leaving error checking out:

int Image_getbuffer(PyObject *self, struct bufferinfo *view) {

    static Py_ssize_t suboffsets[2] = { -1, 0 };

    view->buf = self->lines;
    view->len = self->height*self->width;
    view->readonly = 0;
    view->ndims = 2;
    self->shape_array[0] = height;
    self->shape_array[1] = width;
    view->shape = &self->shape_array;
    self->stride_array[0] = sizeof(struct rgba*);  
    self->stride_array[1] = sizeof(struct rgba);
    view->strides = &self->stride_array;
    view->suboffsets = suboffsets;

    self->view_count ++;

    return 0;
} 


int Image_releasebuffer(PyObject *self, struct bufferinfo *view) {
    self->view_count--;
    return 0;
}
