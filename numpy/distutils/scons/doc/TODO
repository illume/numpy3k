Remaining things:
    - Add NETLIB blas and lapack
    - check windows
    - umfpack checker
    - finish scipy
    - Add CPPPDEFINES in perflib checkers 
    - CXX optimizations flags + Control cxxflags from env
    - CLAPACK: check old atlas
    - handle inplace
    - doc

Things to implement / problems to solve:
    - Make 'real' python extension builders
    - f2py interoperability ?
    - fortran compiler optimization / option (underscore and so on)

F2py:
    - Numpy version to handle build dir issues
    - Difference between .f and .pyf:

Builder:
    - Get a PythonExtension builder independant of distutils for upstream
      integration
    - Get a CtypesExtension builder independant of distutils for upstream
      integration

Tests:
    - What can be tested ?

Fortran:
    - Rewrite verbose output parser using shlex for quote handling
    - improve Fortran runtime detection for upstream integration
    - improve Fortran mangling and dummy main detection for upstream
      integration

Not so important things:
    - improve BrokenMathlib and Mathlib in core, and make them available to
      everyone
    - Generic Api builders (with dep tracking)
    - Generic FromTemplate builder (with dep tracking)

Documentation:
    - scons / distutils integration, global design (BuildDir, directories, etc...)
    - use cases: package developers (examples, etc...), numpy developers,
      building numpy with scons, etc...
