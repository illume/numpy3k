Before True milestone:
    - improve BrokenMathlib and Mathlib in core, and make them available to
      everyone
    - show_config implementation : how to do it ?
    - How to build meta-checkers from simple checkers (for example, BLAS with
      MKL, ATLAS, Sunperf, etc...) ?

Checker:
    - improve Fortran runtime detection for upstream integration
    - improve Fortran mangling and dummy main detection for upstream
      integration

Builder:
    - Get a PythonExtension builder independant of distutils for upstream
      integration
    - Get a CtypesExtension builder independant of distutils for upstream
      integration
    - Generic Api builders (with dep tracking)
    - Generic FromTemplate builder (with dep tracking)

Implementation details:
    - Default optim, warn and link flags for python extension on at least gcc,
      g77, gfortran (1st priority), MS and Intel (2d priority), others (3rd:
      sun, aix, etc...)
    - Refactor code for API generation (numpy/core/code_generators) -> Mostly done

Documentation:
    - scons / distutils integration
    - global design (BuildDir, directories, etc...)
    - package developers documentation
