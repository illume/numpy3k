Before first beta:
    - f2py and scipy interoperability: N hours ?

Design questions:
    - improve BrokenMathlib and Mathlib in core, and make them available to
      everyone
    - overriding compilation flags: env variables, site.cfg ? (autotools
      convention ?)

Builder:
    - Get a PythonExtension builder independant of distutils for upstream
      integration
    - Get a CtypesExtension builder independant of distutils for upstream
      integration
    - Generic Api builders (with dep tracking)
    - Generic FromTemplate builder (with dep tracking)

Tests:
    - What can be tested ?

Fortran:
    - Rewrite verbose output parser using shlex for quote handling
    - improve Fortran runtime detection for upstream integration
    - improve Fortran mangling and dummy main detection for upstream
      integration


Documentation:
    - scons / distutils integration, global design (BuildDir, directories, etc...)
    - use cases: package developers (examples, etc...), numpy developers,
      building numpy with scons, etc...
