NumPy (previously called SciPy core) is a replacement of Numeric Python that
adds the features of numarray.  To install:

python setup.py install

The setup.py script will take advantage of fast BLAS on your system if it can
find it.  You can help the process with a site.cfg file.

If fast BLAS and LAPACK cannot be found, then a slower default version is used. 

The current version is always available from a Subversion repostiory:
